## Directory Setup in R-Studio:
# Before running/importing your csv file you need to run the following commands for you R to detect the working folder:

-----------------------------------------------
  Get the current working directory.         
|                                              |     
  getwd()                                     
|                                              |
    Set the working directory to the folder  
    WorkingDirectory on the C drive.         
|                                              |  
   This folder must be created in Windows   
   before running the code.                   
|                                              | 
   ## Example:                                
  * setwd("B:/SCHOOL/STC/Assignment")          
|                                              |
